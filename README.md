# Compare Similarity (Thesis Sketchup) 
This project is a back-end sketch for my Bachelor thesis. 

*There is also my unfinished personal document (as a test with 09 refs so far) for the Organisational Psychology Course. Please find the essay as reference **only** (because it has not been graded yet). Thank you.* 

**NOTE**: There are 02 files in this project: one run by using command line, one is Jupyter Notebook. 

Command line argument: ```main.py --document OrganisationalCourse.docx```



**Future**:
* Perform gensim, word2vec (in progress)
* Improve the speed with big data
* Return copied text


### Knowledge required: 
Tfidf, cosine similarity, basic HTML, basic NLTK, mySQL query, lemmatization, jaccard similarity, basic argparse if prefer working with cmd argument.
