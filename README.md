# Compare Similarity (Thesis Sketchup) 
This project is a back-end sketch for my Bachelor thesis. 

*There is also my unfinished personal document (as a test with 09 refs so far) for the Organisational Psychology Course. Please find the essay as reference **only** (because it has not been graded yet). Thank you.*

Cmd argument: ```main.py --document OrganisationalCourse.docx```


**Future**:
* Polarity and speech spentiment
* Improve the speed with big data
* Return copied text
* Statistical test (homogeneity test)

*Pretrained model*: [GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/)
